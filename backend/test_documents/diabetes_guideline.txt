# Diabetes Clinical Practice Guidelines

## Overview
Diabetes is a common metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. According to World Health Organization statistics, approximately 422 million adults worldwide have diabetes.

## Pathophysiology
Diabetes is mainly divided into two types:
1. Type 1 diabetes: Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency
2. Type 2 diabetes: Insulin resistance and insufficient insulin secretion

## Clinical Manifestations
### Common Symptoms
- Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia (three polys)
- Weight loss
- Blurred vision
- Fatigue and weakness

### Complications
- Microvascular complications: Retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy
- Macrovascular complications: Coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease

## Diagnostic Criteria
According to American Diabetes Association standards, diagnosis can be made if any of the following conditions are met:
1. Fasting blood glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L
2. 2-hour postprandial blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L
3. Glycated hemoglobin ≥6.5%
4. Typical symptoms + random blood glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L

## Treatment Plans

### Type 1 Diabetes Treatment
- Insulin replacement therapy
- Blood glucose monitoring
- Dietary management

### Type 2 Diabetes Treatment
#### Lifestyle Interventions
- Diet control
- Regular exercise
- Weight reduction

#### Pharmacological Treatment
First-line: Metformin
Second-line: Sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors

## Prevention Measures
### Primary Prevention
- Healthy diet
- Regular exercise
- Weight control
- Smoking cessation and alcohol limitation

### Screening Recommendations
- People aged ≥45 years should undergo regular screening
- High-risk groups such as obese, hypertensive, and dyslipidemic individuals should start screening earlier

## Monitoring and Follow-up

### Self-monitoring
- Blood glucose monitoring frequency adjusted according to treatment plan
- Record blood glucose values and related factors

### Regular Follow-up
- Follow-up every 3-6 months
- Check glycated hemoglobin
- Assess complications

## Conclusion
Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring long-term management. Through standardized treatment and monitoring, blood glucose can be effectively controlled, complications prevented, and patient quality of life improved.
